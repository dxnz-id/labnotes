<!-- # **SIPUPS** | e-Book Based Library Information System 📚  

SIPUPS (e-Book Based Library Information System) is a digital platform designed to efficiently manage book lending in the form of e-books. Built using **Filament v3.x** on the **Laravel 11.x** framework, SIPUPS provides a modern and intuitive interface for **administrators, officers, and visitors**.  

- **Administrators** have full control over managing books and user data.  
- **Officers** can only manage the e-book collection.  
- **Visitors** can **read e-books directly** within the system without downloading them, ensuring secure and controlled access.  

Key features include:  
✅ Drag-and-drop functionality to upload book covers and PDFs.  
✅ Authentication using `filament/user`.  
✅ A **responsive admin panel** for seamless management.
